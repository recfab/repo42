I have been meaning to create a blog for a while, but I keep procrastinating--usually by overthinking which technology to use.

<!-- truncate -->

I had planned to use Sphinx for this site.
I like it a lot as a documentation system, but didn't like the how the blogging plugin worked (also for "overthinking" reasons).

I wanted something designed for blogging so I can focus on writing and stop fretting about technology decisions.

I have also been wanting to freshen up on front end related things.
For the first chunk of my career, I was a fullstack developer, but for the last few years, I've been doing infrastructure, CI/CD and other DevOps things.
I've missed fullstack and especially frontend work.

With its MDX support, [Docusaurus.io](https://docusaurus.io/docs) seems like a good fit.
So that's what I'm using.
