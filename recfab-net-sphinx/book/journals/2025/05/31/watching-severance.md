# Watching Severance

- "His face looks like a donut" about Dylan #ShitMyPartnerSays
- "This whole show is a liminal space " #ShitMyPartnerSays
- Welp. Burt's ~~dead~~retired. Irving is not happy.
- Holy shit his wife isn't dead! His wife is Ms. Casey! 😱
- Seth Milchik is his full name.
- Managers get last names and are not severed. Workers get first names and are.
- Except Ms. Casey who has a last name and is severed and is "retiring". Her life has been 107 hours long.
- "She tried to stab him with her eyes" #ShitMyPartnerSays
- Ms Corel sounds like a literal wambulance.
- This scene is trying to be sexy and weird but it's just weird.
- Mark's sister Devon and her husband Ricken are both fucking weird.
- Wait, Irving's outie has been painting the retirement hallway this whole time. The goo she. He nods off is paint. wtf. Has he been retired before?
- Helly is on the board!? No wonder she's such a bitch. Or the daughter of the current CEO I guess.
