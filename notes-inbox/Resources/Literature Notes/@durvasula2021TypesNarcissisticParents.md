# The 5 Types of Narcissistic Parents

- [ ] Go back through this and clean it up
    - I started writing this note as a general note on "Narcissism", and then most of the way through decided to make it a literature note
    - For each type, she briefly covered what it means, but mostly she seemed to assume the type were already know.
    - She focused on how they are as parents from the perspective of the child, as well as from the perspective of a co-parent. I want to make sure this note covers both of those.

## Types

    - arrogant
    - selfish
    - care about looks more than how they are
    - all about them, all the time

    - more menacing
    - more manipulative/lying
    - paranoid or sadistic
    - cold as parent
    - concerned with power, control and dominance

- [[Covert Narcissist]]
    - present as victims or vulnerable
    - "deserve more from life"
    - make their children feel they have to rescue them
