# Evaluate Journals Plugin v2 (Companion Repo)

This is a test vault for evaluating v2 of the Journals plugin for Obsidian.
None of the content is from my real vaults, but I may end up using this structure for them.
That structure is as follows:

- `/Work Journal` contains daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, annual journals, as well as sprint journals, grouped by quarter
- `/Public Journal` contains a possible structure for my blog
- `/Personal Journals` contains daily journals for my private notes as well as for my last two jobs. I didn't really use weekly, monthly, etc. notes at those last two jobs, and I don't currently use them in my private journal.
