# Decision Log

I tend to overthink and overanalyze everything.
It often means I waste time debating how to do `X` rather than actually doing it.
Usually, these decisions are not worth the time spent, and I would be better served making a decision, sticking to it, and moving on.
This folder is an attempt to force myself to do that.
Nothing is permanent--I can change my mind later--but by forcing myself to decide, and writing down why I chose that way, I am hoping to trick myself into spending less time thinking, and more time doing.
