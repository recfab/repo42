## CONSIDER monorepo structure 

Maybe something like 

* projects/
* lab/
  * little ad hoc, exploratory scripts
* pkm/
* scripts
  * build.sh
  * things that made it out of `lab` but aren’t projects
  * need a better name that conveys the meaning. Maybe somethnn in big real boring like `utils`

## Misc

- CONSIDER rename `yggdrasil` to `workspace` or something like that
