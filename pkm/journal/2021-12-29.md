Is “journal” vs “notes” a meaningful distinction?

- does my particularity hold me back?
- I read so much and think so much before I actually do anything.
- I keep thinking: embrace the chaos; throw it all in and add form to it later
- that’s *part* of why I wanted to try monorepo
- but it feels so foreign
- I like organizing things
- I just want a way that isn’t brittle so I can change later.
