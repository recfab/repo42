## All my files are gone

10 years of files in Dropbox, nearly all of it gone

Transferring Dropbox to OneDrive didn’t work. I fucked it up.

And instead of verifying everything was there, I just deleted all of Dropbox for I don’t know what fucking reason.

It’s all gone and it’s my fault.

### Update

It’s okay. My old laptop that Mino uses still had the Dropbox files.

Still, I need to be as careful with my own data as I am with work’s
