None of this “pkm”, “drafts”, “archive” crap. 
It’s all just notes. 
Every file is a markdown file with a time stamp based name. 
That time stamp serves as the note’s ID. 
If I need to attach media to a note, I can create a folder named after the ID and move the file into it. 
Or have a “media” folder and reference that.
