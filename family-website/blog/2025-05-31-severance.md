# Watching Severance on AppleTv

Welp. Burt's ~~dead~~retired. Irving is not happy.

Holy shit his wife isn't dead! His wife is Ms. Casey! 😱

Seth Milchik is his full name.

Managers get last names and are not severed. Workers get first names and are. 
Except Ms. Casey who has a last name and is severed and is "retiring". Her life has been 107 hours long. 

> **Mino:** "She tried to stab him with her eyes."

Ms. Corel sounds like a literal wambulance.

This scene is trying to be sexy and weird but it's just weird. 

Mark's sister Devon and her husband Ricken are both fucking weird.

Wait, Irving's outie has been painting the retirement hallway this whole time. The goo he sees when he nods off is paint. wtf. Has he been retired before?

Helly is on the board!? No wonder she's such a bitch. Or the daughter of the current CEO I guess.
