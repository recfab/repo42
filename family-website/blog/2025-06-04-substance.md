# The Substance

Watching body horror movie _The Substance_. 
Demi Moore playing an aging actress who gets fired from her local TV station exercise show job for being too old, and is so obsesses with looking pretty at that specific job that she starts taking this fucked up goo that makes her a second, younger, hotter body.
She has to swap back and forth between them every 7 days or _bad things happen_ (foreshadowing).

> ** Mino:** "Bitch you nasty on purpose"

- She went all kinds of crazy all kinds of fast

> ** Mino:** "I told you you were gonna get rotten. Teenagers." 

This chick does look like a child.

> ** Mino:** "This is like an episode of Tales from the Crypt. It's goofy." 

> ** Mino:** "Wow, you have an iceberg of confidence lady" 

About Monstro Elisasue.

> ** Mino:** "That child should t been there in the first place. Shame on yall. "
