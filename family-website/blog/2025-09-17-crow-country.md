The main character, talking to no one in particular : "My name is Mara Forest. And don't you forget it."

> **Mino:** "it's like trying to shoot spaghetti"

About this tall fucker with the spindly limbs.

Turning a crank to open a gate 

> Mino: "old spaghetti legs is gonna get me. I'm just praying."

In the arcade:

> Marvin: "what's your name?"
> Mara: "Mara"
> Marvin: "That's like the girl version of my name!"

> Marvin: "how old are you?"
> Mara: "old enough"

Is this a teenager who stole her cop dad's gun?
