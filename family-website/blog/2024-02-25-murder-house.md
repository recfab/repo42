# Mino plays Murder House

> **Mino:** "I love how the screaming hasn't stopped. I love that."

> **Mino:** "You would think down would make me move back but no: it makes me spin."

They make the Resident Evil controls seem smooth.

> **Mino:** "Uh I'm gonna go because the screaming is intensifying."

> **Mino:** "He's gonna find me. If he finds me I'm not gonna keep playing. It's too creepy."

> **Mino:** "why do his eyes look like their upside down? And his hands look like a stack a pancakes."

> **Mino:** "A 2 foot tall 8-year old who runs slower than I walk."
