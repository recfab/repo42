title: Watching Mino play "Brookhaven"
---

- She dressed up as a cute little teddy bear in an aqua outfit 🧸👗
- Then she broke into someone's house to rob her and set the house on fire
- Instead of kicking Mino out, this chick adopted her
- She picked her up, sets her down in a chair and gives her a milk shake 🥤
- Now she has made Mino a roommate in her house 
- how old Is this kid? This is Roblox so it's probably a child.
- Now she has literally made Mino her daughter. Good thing she's cute. 

> **Mino:** "I'm her daughter bear. We go and run errands and stuff"

- Her English is strange. Mino thinks she is speaking French and using a translator.
