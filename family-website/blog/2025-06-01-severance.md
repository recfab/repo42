# Watching Severance on AppleTv

> **Mino:** "I'm just gonna call him Donut. He doesn't look like a Dylan; he looks like a Donut." 

Definite matrix vibes

> **Mino:** "Why does he always look like a donut?"  

> **Mino:** "They named him Mark because he's unremarkable." 

Seriously, why is there a child here?

I came back from getting a snack and asked if there was anything worth rewinding for: 

> **Mino:** "No. They fucked and Irving's out in the woods. Pretty mediocre."

> **Mino:** "why the fuck is Gollum's bride sitting at that computer?"  

Holy shit, Helly was a mole! Mark fucked the Outie! She came back just to fuck him!?

Dang! Irving started as a true believer in this corporate cult. I guess it makes sense the betrayal would hit him the hardest.

This show gets more and more bizarre.
