About Mitchell Linn.

Of course the vacuum's name is Hoover

Luna, the console

Luna keeps saying something that looks almost like my name, but misspelled and lowercase. It's supposed to be sci-fi bullshit slang I guess but I don't have any idea what it's supposed to mean.

I called Scandalabra an old lump of wax and he stormed off.

Washford and Drysdale

The washer and dryer aren't talking to each other. 

Washford has an ab window:

I apologized for leaving wet laundry in the wash so many times. Washford is being a drama queen about it.

Oh I get it! The W/D are acrobats because they _tumble_.

there is so much drama in this laundry room. The hamper and the dirty laundry are fighting too.

What a weird couple.

The background plot of this game is wild: stolen technology with potential military uses, and government cover ups. Meanwhile, I'm like "I'm dating my couch because his lap is comfy."

The washing machine hates his job.

WTF. I talked to Luna again and it started over like she didn't recognize me. I thought it was weird that it didn't list us as friends... I guess she resets when you beat the game.
She planned ahead for time travel shenanigans. I just have to tell her "Lingeonberries", and she'll believe me, like a time travel safe word.

We're gonna date the guards

I winked at her

What in the fourth wall is going on?

He's just a GRUNT

I told her to match her date's energy and she said "let's fucking fight!"

Why did Florence show up when I looked at the popcorn ceiling in the hallway? I was looking for Celia.

The floor is the ceilings secretary. Ok.

Someone is fleecing Florence!

Lux on why he's the main character and I'm the NPC: "There's one of you in the house, and theres what, 16 of me or some shit?" They are both an ass and an idiot.

I got them to hate me so Regina "Reggie" Rejection shows up.

They told they show up every time I get rejected. I said "Fuck me." 📷

Those are not the globes I thought I'd be talking to. 📷

My reward for buying the DLC is getting to see her press her boobs together I guess.

Regina is voiced by Bill Butts

> **Mino:** "Do you want a pony boy you lowercase bitch?" 

I have no idea. Something about the name of the song.

I am upgrading my adorable computer, Mac.

My computer wants to see other people.
