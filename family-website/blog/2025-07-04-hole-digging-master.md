# Hole Digging Master

Just using a Auto shovel in the backyard. Nbd.

Very cutesy piano music. 🎼🎹

I asked who she's selling rocks to for $2 a piece:  

> **Mino:** "Some dumb kid down the road I guess."

You get a jetpack! Rad!

> **Mino:** "Climbing out of this damn hole is long enough to be a windows screensaver." 

This game is wild. 
We've found the bottom. 
There was a statues and a chest and when you touch the statue it zaps you, leaving just your boots.
Then you spawn back home for end game.

These are the video guides we used to 100% the game:
