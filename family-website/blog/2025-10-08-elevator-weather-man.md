I'm coming back in with my door dash order. 
Someone else comes with his dinner at the same time. 
He holds the door. I say thanks and follow. 
He holds the elevator room door. I say thanks and follow. 
He gets on the elevator and hits 5.
I hit 4 and mind my business. 

At floor 2 the silence is killing him so he says "last day, huh?"

> **Me:** 😐
> **Elevator Weather Man:** "of the sun"

Ominous. 

> **Me:** "I guess"
> **EWM:** "and then it rains for 3 days"

I frantically try to exit this conversation, right as the elevator arrives at 4 and ramble something I've forgotten now.

> **EWM:** "oh which side are you on?"

Of the building. Duh. I point. 

> **EWM:** "oh, Ok have a nice day"
