# 2021-01-?? One-on-one with Sai

January... sometime

- 2020 not as successful as 2019
- goal: be able to say how awesome in mult things in 2021

## Framework
- understand problem space
- value it has; why doing the thing
- expected delivery timeline
- comfort with ambiguity
  - make assumption, move forward
  - document the assumption
- break into chunks and create implementation plan
- communicate with producers more often
