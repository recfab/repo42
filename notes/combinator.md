# Combinator

A combinator is any function which only depends on its inputs.[^1]

Often used as a shortened form of "Combinator Pattern" or "Combinator library".
Combinator libraries are libraries of functions that take multiple things of the same type as input, and produce a thing of that same type as output.[^2]
