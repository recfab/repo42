- trying to establish perfection in the decision itself
    - actually, just procrastinating
- often, doing nothing is worse than doing something
    - e.g. choosing healthcare during open enrollment
    - enrolling in classes in college
- Trick: think through the decision to the worst outcome
    - Often, find out the worst outcome isn't as bad as you think

(this next quote is paraphrased)
> You must think of over-analysis as an addiction
> -- Eckhart Toley (sic), _The Power of Now_
