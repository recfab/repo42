## Meeting: CI/CD Metrics Sync

@ 10:00AM

Organizer: Ben Kimball

:book: Accelerate

* measure _outcomes_ not outputs
  * e.g. productivity by lines of code is useless because customers don't by lines of code
* concern: accuracy of automation numbers
* concern: quantitative measures of qualitative concepts
* concern: metrics that measure something related to our goals

### 2 parts

* automated metrics
* subjective measurements
* builds not yet in prod
* Theory: any code not yet in prod is a liability

## One-on-one with Sai @ 4:30

January...
sometime

* 2020 not as successful as 2019
* goal: be able to say how awesome in multiple things in 2021

### Framework

* understand problem space
* value it has; why doing the thing
* expected delivery timeline
* comfort with ambiguity
  * make assumption, move forward
  * document the assumption
* break into chunks and create implementation plan
* communicate with producers more often
