= Combinator

A combinator is any function which only depends on its inputs.footnote:1[https://youtu.be/RDalzi7mhdY?t=833]

Often used as a shortened form of "Combinator Pattern" or "Combinator library".
Combinator libraries are libraries of functions that take multiple things of the same type as input, and produce a thing of that same type as output.footnote:2[https://wiki.haskell.org/Combinator]
