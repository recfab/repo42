# Markdown vs. Asciidoc

## Verdict

Check the extension of this file.
I am choosing Markdown as my default markup language.

* It is deliberately simplistic, but I mostly want to write little notes and it is sufficient for that purpose.
* Ubiquity, and the excellent tooling support that comes with it, is more important to me than "correctness".
* Lack of tools mean I would have to write tools myself, and while that sounds fun, I'm not likely to actually do that.
* Pandoc Markdown supports more of the missing feature anyway

## Thoughts

### Markdown

* syntax looks nicer
* ubiquitous
* lots of tooling
* many flavors, but they mostly seem to comply with CommonMark, or GitHub Flavored Markdown, so I don't count this as a problem.
* simple, on purpose.
* I like how the frontmatter looks in GitLab's UI
* nicer footnote syntax

### Asciidoc

* more features
* some of the syntax for some of the "advanced" features are complicated and ugly
* very little tooling
* small community
* admonitions are nice
* labeling lists and listings and such is nice, esp. with cross references
* description lists are nice
* conceptually, I like the idea of using description lists
