## Meeting: Deep Dive into Architectural Templates

Gwen Buchthal, 2021-04-21 @ 10:00:00

* Things that have bubbled up for Gwen as a new hire
* Templating
* Serverless vs Containerization
* Templates
  * => Consistency => Simplicity
  * portability (people move teams)
  * interfaces
  * rapid service creation
* Lots of AWS resources created programatically that don't get cleaned up.
  * Should be converted to CloudFormation Stack or Terraform state file
