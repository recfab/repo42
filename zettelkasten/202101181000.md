# Meeting: CI/CD Metrics Sync

book: Accelerate

- measure *outcomes* not outputs
  - e.g. productivity by lines of code is useless because customers don't by lines of code
- concern: accuracy of automation numbers
- concern: quantitative measures of qualitative concepts
- concern: metrics that measure something related to our goals

2 parts:

- automated metrics
- subjective measurements

- builds not yet in prod
  - Theory: any code not yet in prod is a liability
