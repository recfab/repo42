= Myst Remake: Clock Tower Puzzle
:source-highlighter: highlight.js
:highlightjs-languages: fsharp

There is a clock tower on the South side of the island. Inside is a puzzle with gears and levers.
The goal is to pull the levers in the right order to get the gears into the correct state.

I had thought solve this with a state machine, using F#.

* 3 gears, stacked on top of each other, with the teeth labeled 1, 2 or 3

----
include::session.fsx[tags=state]
----

* 2 levers, each changing 2 of the 3 numbers
+
[source,fsharp]
----
include::session.fsx[tags=levers]
----

There is a `diagram` function, which generates a State Machine diagram

Unfortunately, it never resolves.
I must have the misunderstood the rules, or found the wrong starting clue.
